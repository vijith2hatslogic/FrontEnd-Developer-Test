# Wistia Share URLs - Implementation Complete! ✅

## What's Been Added

I've successfully implemented Wistia shareable URLs functionality. Now, in addition to embedded videos, you'll also get direct shareable links to the Wistia dashboard!

## 🎯 Features Added

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**New Columns Added:**
- `webcam_share_url` - Wistia shareable URL for webcam recording
- `screen_share_url` - Wistia shareable URL for screen recording

**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/20251014_add_wistia_share_urls.sql`

### 2. Updated Data Flow

```
Recording → Upload to Wistia → Returns:
  - embedUrl (for iframe display)
  - shareUrl (for direct access) ✨ NEW!
→ Both saved to database
→ Displayed in admin dashboard
```

### 3. Admin Dashboard Enhancements

**Submission Details Page Now Shows:**

📹 **Wistia Recording Links** (Blue highlighted box)
- Clickable links to view recordings directly on Wistia
- External link icon for easy identification
- Separate links for webcam and screen recordings
- Helpful tip about downloading/sharing capabilities

**Example Display:**
```
📹 Wistia Recording Links
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Webcam: View on Wistia 🔗          │
│ Screen: View on Wistia 🔗          │
│                                      │
│ 💡 Click links to view, download,   │
│    or share recordings directly     │
│    from Wistia                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Debug Information Enhanced

Debug info box now shows:
- Embed URL (for iframe)
- Share URL (for direct access) ✨ NEW!

## 📁 Files Modified

1. ✅ **Database**
   - `supabase/migrations/20251014_add_wistia_share_urls.sql` (NEW)
   - `apply-migration.sh` (UPDATED)

2. ✅ **TypeScript Interfaces**
   - `src/lib/storage.ts` - Added `webcamShareUrl` and `screenShareUrl` fields

3. ✅ **Recording Manager**
   - `src/components/tasks/BasicRecordingManager.tsx` - Passes share URLs to parent

4. ✅ **Test Submission Page**
   - `src/app/test/[testUrl]/page.tsx` - Captures and stores share URLs

5. ✅ **Admin Submission View**
   - `src/app/dashboard/tests/[id]/submissions/[submissionId]/page.tsx` - Displays share URL links

## 🚀 How to Apply

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd /Users/2hatslogic/Documents/Front-end\ Developer\ Machine\ Test/frontend-dev-test

# Make script executable
chmod +x apply-migration.sh

# Run migration
./apply-migration.sh
```

**OR** manually in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS webcam_share_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE test_submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS screen_share_url TEXT;
```

### Step 2: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test with New Submission

1. Create a test submission
2. Complete recording
3. Submit
4. View submission details
5. Look for the blue "📹 Wistia Recording Links" box

## 💡 What You Can Do with Share URLs

### From Admin Dashboard:

1. **Click "View on Wistia"** links to:
   - Watch recordings on Wistia's platform
   - Download original files
   - Share with team members
   - Get embed codes
   - Access Wistia analytics
   - Change video settings

### Share URL Features:

- **Direct Access**: Opens recording directly in your Wistia account
- **Download**: Download original video file
- **Share**: Share with anyone (respecting Wistia privacy settings)
- **Analytics**: See who viewed the video
- **Manage**: Edit, trim, add captions, etc.

## 📊 Data Structure

### Stored in Database:

```typescript
{
  // Existing fields
  webcamRecording: "https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/abc123",
  screenRecording: "https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/def456",
  
  // NEW fields
  webcamShareUrl: "https://home.wistia.com/medias/abc123", ✨
  screenShareUrl: "https://home.wistia.com/medias/def456"  ✨
}
```

### What Each URL Does:

- **embedUrl** (`webcamRecording`/`screenRecording`):
  - Used for embedding in iframe
  - Displays video player in your dashboard
  - Format: `https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/{hashedId}`

- **shareUrl** (`webcamShareUrl`/`screenShareUrl`): ✨ NEW!
  - Direct link to Wistia dashboard
  - Opens in Wistia media library
  - Full access to video management
  - Format: `https://home.wistia.com/medias/{hashedId}`

## 🎨 UI Design

### Blue Highlighted Box

Located at the top of the "Monitoring Recordings" section:

- **Background**: Light blue (`bg-blue-50`)
- **Border**: Blue (`border-blue-200`)
- **Icon**: 📹 emoji
- **Links**: Primary brand color with hover effect
- **External Icon**: SVG icon indicating external link
- **Helper Text**: Blue info text

### Responsive Design

- Works on all screen sizes
- Links wrap nicely on mobile
- Touch-friendly click areas
- Clear visual hierarchy

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Share URLs Not Appearing

**Check 1:** Migration Applied?

# Table Editor → test_submissions → 
# Look for: webcam_share_url, screen_share_url
```

**Check 2:** Debug Info

- Should show both "Embed URL" and "Share URL"
- If only embed URL shows, migration may not be applied

**Check 3:** Old vs New Submissions
- Only NEW submissions (after this update) will have share URLs
- Old submissions only have embed URLs

### Links Don't Work

**Check 1:** Wistia Account Access
- Links open in YOUR Wistia account
- Make sure you're logged into Wistia.com

- Search by candidate name or timestamp
